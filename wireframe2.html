            <h2>What is pseudocode?</h2>
            <p>In computer science, pseudocode is a description of the steps in an algorithm using a mix of conventions
                of programming languages (like assignment operator, conditional operator, loop) with informal, usually
                self-explanatory, notation of actions and conditions. Although pseudocode shares features with
                regular programming languages, it is intended for human reading rather than machine control. Pseudocode
                typically omits details that are essential for machine implementation of the algorithm, meaning that
                pseudocode can only be verified by hand. The programming language is augmented with natural language
                description details, where convenient, or with compact mathematical notation. The purpose of using
                pseudocode is that it is easier for people to understand than conventional programming language code,
                and that it is an efficient and environment-independent description of the key principles of an
                algorithm. It is commonly used in textbooks and scientific publications to document algorithms and in
                planning of software and other algorithms. </p>

                    <h3>The main constructs of pseudocode</h3>
                    <p>The main constructs of pseudocode are essential for representing six fundamental programming
                        concepts, always written in uppercase: SEQUENCE, CASE, WHILE, REPEAT-UNTIL, FOR, and
                        IF-THEN-ELSE.
                        These constructs, also called keywords, describe the control flow of an algorithm.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>SEQUENCE</b> represents linear tasks that are performed one after the other in order.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>WHILE</b> is a loop with acondition checked at the beginning.</li>
                        <li><b>REPEAT-UNTIL</b> is a loop with a condition evaluated at the end. </li>
                        <li><b>FOR</b> is another way of looping with a set number of iterations.</li>
                        <li><b>IF-THEN-ELSE</b> is a conditional statement that changes the flow of the algorithm based
                            on a
                            specified condition.</li>
                        <li><b>CASE</b> is a more generalized form of IF-THEN-ELSE, often used for multiple conditional
                            branches.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Together, these constructs allow for clear and logical representation of algorithms in
                        pseudocode.
